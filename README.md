# credit-card-fraud-detection-using-machine-learning-methods
This repository is dedicated to the implementation and analysis of machine learning models for detecting credit card fraud, as part of my dissertation research. It encompasses all stages of the project, from data preprocessing to model training and performance evaluation. The models employed include advanced algorithms such as Random Forest, XGBoost, and CatBoost, specifically optimized to handle the challenges of highly imbalanced datasets typical in fraud detection. The objective is to enhance the precision and efficiency of fraud detection systems, contributing to greater security and reliability in financial transactions.
